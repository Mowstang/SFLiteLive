                <b>Fantastic Feedback for STRONE PRO Branch</b><br />
                Hi Terry (Crawford Adjuster),<br />
                Thank you again for bringing Strone to the rescue and restoration, they did a fabulous job! (Only 
                carpet remains to be done, but I am sure it will be done soon and very well).<br />
                Hi Derek (Salciccioli),<br />
                Thank you for assigning Paul (Paveo) to our project. He finished his part yesterday and did an excellent job!
                We would like to take the opportunity to, once again, praise Paul for his outstanding workmanship 
                and exceptional work ethics.
                Best regards,
                Yuri and Olena

                    STRONE Receives Gold Standard Designation in Canada's Best Managed Companies Program

                <b>STRONE Receives Gold Standard Designation in Canada's Best Managed Companies Program</b><br />
                A first year winner of Canada's Best Managed Companies program in 2012 and again in 2013 and 2014, 
                STRONE has demonstrated its commitment to the Best Managed program and successfully requalified for the 
                award as a Gold Standard winner in 2015. The Best Managed Gold Standard designation recognizes organizations 
                for winning the nationally recognized Best Managed award for four consecutive years.<br />
                "We are thrilled and very honoured to achieve the Gold Standard as a Best Managed Company in Canada," explains 
                Neil Blinco, Co-CEO Marketing and Sales. "We sincerely thank our employees, partners, and suppliers for their 
                support in helping STRONE reach this esteemed recognition."<br />
                Applicants are evaluated by an independent judging panel on overall business performance, including leadership, 
                strategy, core competencies, cross-functional collaboration throughout organization, and talent.
                "I would like to recognize the entire efforts of STRONE. It takes a dedicated effort from an entire team to 
                focus on a core vision, create stakeholder value and excel in the global economy to achieve this level of 
                success," said Peter Brown, Partner, Deloitte and Co-Leader, Canada's Best Managed Companies program.<br />
                In a challenging year for insurance property restoration contractors, STRONE made a series of challenging 
                operational changes to adapt to the current economic environment. "After 28 years in this industry there is one 
                thing we can be sure of, not one day, week, month, or year is ever the same," states Steve Blinco, Co-CEO Support 
                Services. "We have found that change is inevitable and adaptability to change is a necessity." These operational 
                adjustments and refocused strategies have strengthened STRONE to continue supporting its clients in the years to come.

                <b>Walkers and Runners Needed for Ride for Heart</b><br />
                That's correct. In addition to riders, we are also looking for walkers and runners to participate in 
                the 2016 Ride for Heart in Toronto on June 5th.<br />
                In addition to 25, 50, and 75 km riding routes, the Heart & Stroke Foundation has added walk (5 km) 
                and run (5 and 10 km) routes on the Gardiner Expressway. This June we will ride, run, and walk for heart!
                This is year four for Team STRONE-Itech. We participate as a corporate team, which provides us with an 
                enhanced event experience. We have our own table(s) in the Better Living Centre (great when weather doesn't 
                cooperate), event t-shirt, complimentary breakfast before we go out and a fantastic lunch when we return. 
                All we ask is for you to fundraise at least $100, but please feel free to exceed that goal.
                It is a memorable experience, one that has actually changed my personal lifestyle, kick starting a passion 
                for riding. If you have any interest or questions, please contact me at robs@itechenvironmental.ca or 905-979-4705.
